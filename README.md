## React Native Course
This is the code used for the React Native course that I'm currently working through.

### Folder Structure
Repo contains 2 folders:

- `base/` - App for demoing the basics of React Native in a simple way.
- `food/` - App to bring together everything learnt so far in a Restaurant Search App.
- `food-rn6/` - The same as the food app above, but converted to use RN6 syntax for navigation especially.
- `blog/` - Blog app that demonstrates more advanced state management techniques (basically Redux)
- `json-server/` - Server that allows user to persist blogposts for the demo blog app, uses `ngrok` & `json-server`
- `track-server/` - Basic server setup to allow persisting of tracks data to MongoDB for Tracks RN app
